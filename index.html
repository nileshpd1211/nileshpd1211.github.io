  <b>KSVD-OMP Sparse Representation</b>
</h1>

  <h2> Abstract </h2>
 Sparse representation has attracted much attention from researchers in fields of signal
processing, image processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Sparse representation also has a
good reputation in both theoretical research and practical applications. Many different algorithms have been
proposed for sparse representation. The main purpose of this project is to provide an experimental study of applying 
sparse representation in an iterative manner. We approach this study using two techniques namely orthogonal matching pursuit(OMP)
and KSVD
Task to be done:
<ul>
  <li>To create an overcomplete dictionary by using the K-SVD approach</li>
  <li>Create a sparse distribution using iterative sparse coding</li>
  <li>Reconstruct the sparse signal by orthogonal matching pursuit(OMP)</li>
</ul>

  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  Given an image
  <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=x\in&space;\mathbb{R}^n" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x\in&space;\mathbb{R}^n" title="x\in \mathbb{R}^n" /></a>
  ,we can represent it as: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=x&space;=&space;\mathbf{D}\&space;\alpha" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x&space;=&space;\mathbf{D}\&space;\alpha" title="x = \mathbf{D}\ \alpha" /></a>
  where <b>D</b> indicates the dictionary we choose, and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\alpha" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha" title="\alpha" /></a>
  is the expression for <b>x</b> in the new represented space.
  <b> D</b> is  <i> n x L </i> matrix where each column is a word and consists L words in total. Popular selection for <b>D</b>are : Fourier,
wavelet, wavelet packet, cosine packet, and curvelet etc.
  <p> Sparse representation means to look for a good
expression with fewest words, namely <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\left&space;|&space;\left&space;|&space;\alpha&space;\right&space;|&space;\right|&space;<&space;<&space;n" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left&space;|&space;\left&space;|&space;\alpha&space;\right&space;|&space;\right|&space;<&space;<&space;n" title="\left | \left | \alpha \right | \right| < < n" /></a> . In most
applications, the dictionary is selected as a priori from the common orthogonal bases such as Fourier, wavelet etc.
or combinations of them.
